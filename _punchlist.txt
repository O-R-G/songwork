*EMAIL ALERTS*
Could we automatically send info@songwork.org every time a sound is
uploaded? This would alert us to check ORG and approve / update the sound
so that there's little delay in making it appear on the site. Otherwise
we'll have to repeatedly check to see if there's something new to approve.

*MISSING LETTERS ON ORG LIST VIEW*
After uploading a sound, in the list view of ORG the first letter of the
first word of the title sometimes appears deleted. E.g. there are two
tracks for 'Kippax Paraprint...' (01 and 02). One appears as 'Kippax' the
other as 'ippax'. Even after correcting it, the changes still don't appear
to update in the list view. At first glance, this doesn't seem to carry
over to the front end where both titles appear as normal (Kippax 01, Kippax
02). HOWEVER when searching for 'Kippax', only one track appears. But then
if searching for 'ippax', both appear, both starting with the title
'Kippax'. Weird...

*CONTROLLING PLAYBACK*
At the moment, playback controls are limited to play and pause. When on a
page for an individual sound, could it be fixed so that users can use the
playbar to, say, scroll/go back or forward? And is there a way that would
allow them to stop the track mid-way and play from the beginning without
having to wait until the end or refreshing the page -- maybe the play
button could function as this too?
