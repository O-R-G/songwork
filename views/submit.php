		SONG WORK is an online audio library of workplace noise. The library serves as a resource to (1) inspire the creation of new ‘work songs’ for the 21st century; and (2) to conserve the sound heritage of work environments in Scotland. The kinds of sounds we hope to capture include machinery, computer or robotic noises, sounds of hand-making processes in the workshop or studio, and background or ‘ambient’ noise. All sounds are Creative-Commons-licensed for musicians, artists and sound designers to download and use for free.

		Attached to each recording will be a set of data describing where and when the sound was captured, the name and nature of your business, and a short description of the focus of the recording. When submitting a new recording for consideration, please provide the following information, to be displayed on the online archive, formatted according to the example in grey.

		<div>The information submitted in this part ensure that the recording is added to the collection in strict accordance with the wishes of the workplace. Recordings will be uploaded to the SONG WORK library and may be used in electronic media for creative, education and research purposes. Some sounds will be shared with our partners for permanent preservation in the National Library of Scotland or British Library Sound Archive as a record of workplace noise and may be used for publication, lectures, broadcasting, public performances, displays and exhibitions. SONG WORK does not intend to capture the human voice. Other than incidental inclusion (e.g. background conversation), no identifiable individuals will feature in any sound recording uploaded to the library or shared with partner organisations, and no personal data will be used. The intellectual property and copyright of the sound recordings created at your workplace hereby belong to SONG WORK under the Copyright, Designs & Patents Act 1988 (‘sound-recording’).
